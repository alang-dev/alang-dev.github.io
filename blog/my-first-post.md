# My First Blog Post

*Published: August 2, 2025*

Welcome to my first blog post! This is written in markdown and will be served as HTML by GitHub Pages.

## What I'm Learning

I'm exploring:
- GitHub Pages for static site hosting
- Markdown for writing blog posts
- HTML for the main homepage

## Next Steps

- Write more blog posts
- Add styling to make it look better
- Maybe add some JavaScript for interactivity
