# Learning Web Development

*Published: August 2, 2025*

Today I'm setting up my personal website using GitHub Pages. It's amazing how easy it is to get a site up and running!

## Tools I'm Using

- **GitHub Pages** - Free static site hosting
- **Markdown** - Easy writing format
- **HTML** - For the main page structure

## Code Example

Here's a simple HTML snippet:

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>This is my website!</p>
```

## What's Next?

I plan to write more about my learning journey and maybe add some CSS to make this look prettier.
